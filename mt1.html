    <title>HTML Formatting Example</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>This is a Main Heading (h1)</h1>

    <p>This is the first paragraph of content. It sets the stage for the rest of the document.</p>

    <h2>This is a Secondary Heading (h2)</h2>

    <p>This second paragraph contains some important formatting examples. We will use **bold** text to highlight key concepts and *italic* text to emphasize less critical but still relevant points. For example, **HTML** stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it is *essential* for structuring web content.</p>

    <h3>This is a Sub-Heading (h3)</h3>

    <h4>This is a Section Heading (h4)</h4>

    <h5>This is a Minor Heading (h5)</h5>

    <h6>This is the Least Important Heading (h6)</h6>

    <p>This is the third and final paragraph. It concludes the example, showing a complete use of the requested elements. Remember, proper use of headings helps with **SEO** (Search Engine Optimization) and **document accessibility**, making your content easier for everyone to understand.</p>
